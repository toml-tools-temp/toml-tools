# TOML-Tools

## Introduction

This [mono-repo][mono-repo] contains a **_set of tools for working with the [Toml][toml] configuration file format_**.

## Why

The common Toml related tooling are Toml -> Json compilers.
But compiling to Json is just one scenario of many,
lets consider some other potential use cases:

- **Building a Toml Syntax Highlighter**.
- **Converting Toml to Yaml**.
- **Building a Toml Beautifier**.
- **Validating Toml versus a given schema**.
- **Providing content assist in a Toml file**.

These scenarios cannot be implemented (well) using
most existing Toml to Json compilers, for example:

- **Lost comments information**.
  - How can we beautify or convert Toml to Yaml if we don't possess the comments information?
- **Lack of Token type & positioning information.**
  - How could we syntax highlight(paint) parts of a Toml file if we do not know
    where every single Token starts and ends (Commas/Parenthesis/Literals/...)?
- **Failing on the first error**
  - How would we implement content assist on a Toml file currently being edited
    if our parser fails on the first error?
- **Lack of full position information**
  - How will we provide useful Schema validation errors if we lack full position information?
  - Full position information would also be needed for the content assist scenario.

## How

This mono repo will contain two types of packages.

- Low level **Infrastructure** (Toml Lexer & Parser implemented using [Chevrotain][chevrotain])
  with advanced capabilities to support the complex scenarios described above.
- Toml (end user) **Tooling** (Beautifier/Compiler/Schema Validator/...) that would be implemented using
  the advanced low level infrastructure packages mentioned above.

## Status (Alpha)

Infrastructure packages:

- [@toml-tools/lexer](./packages/lexer)
- [@toml-tools/parser](./packages/parser)

Tooling Packages:

- [prettier-plugin-toml](./packages/prettier-plugin-toml)
